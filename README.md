# Cost Efficiency and Production Analysis – C Son Paper Mills

## Project Overview

This project analyzes procurement, production efficiency, and pricing strategies for **C Son Paper Mills**, a packaging paper manufacturer based in Kerala, India. The goal was to identify **cost inefficiencies, supplier performance gaps, and pricing opportunities** to improve profitability.

## Objectives

* Evaluate supplier performance and cost variability.
* Estimate per-unit margins for different board types (Coated, Uncoated, Grey).
* Analyze raw material usage and production efficiency.
* Simulate pricing scenarios to assess demand elasticity and profitability impact.
* Provide actionable recommendations to improve cost control and margins.

## Methods

* **Data Collection**: 10 months of procurement and sales records.
* **Data Cleaning**: Standardized supplier names, aggregated monthly costs, built structured datasets.
* **Analytical Techniques**:
  * Trend analysis of raw material costs and supplier reliability.
  * Weighted cost allocation to estimate per-unit margins.
  * Price sensitivity simulation using elasticity-based modeling.
  * Production efficiency metrics for raw material usage.
* **Tools Used**: Python, Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables), custom cost allocation functions.

## Key Findings

* A few suppliers consistently offered lower and more stable prices (e.g., Nambiyattukudy Food & Spices for Boiler Fuel).
* **Bulk procurement** led to reduced costs and measurable improvement in profitability.
* **Uncoated Duplex Boards** (high volume, low margin) represented the largest pricing gap. Even a small price increase significantly boosted profit margins.
* Profitability could be improved by **~15 - 27%** with some cost-optimization strategies according to the assumed elasticity model.

## Recommendations

1. Shift procurement toward top-performing, stable suppliers.
2. Prioritize **bulk purchases** of key inputs (Retention Aid, PAC).
3. Implement **minor price increases** for Uncoated Duplex Boards to capture unrealized margins.
4. Digitize operational data collection to improve long-term decision-making.

## Impact

The analysis demonstrated how **structured data cleaning + applied economic reasoning** can directly inform business strategy. The recommended changes led to **~4% increase in profitability**, highlighting the value of data-driven decision-making in manufacturing and supply chains.
